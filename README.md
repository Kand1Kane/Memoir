# Memoir: A Journey in Preserving Memories  

## Inspiration  
The idea for **Memoir** was born from a deeply personal realization—how fragile our memories can be. Seeing how Alzheimer’s and memory loss affect individuals and their loved ones, we wanted to create a tool that helps people reconnect with their past. We envisioned an app that could **sort, recognize, and retell** the moments that define our lives, ensuring that no memory fades into oblivion.  

## What We Learned  
Building **Memoir** taught us invaluable lessons about **machine learning, user experience, and accessibility**. We explored **facial recognition models**, **audio listeners**, and **data organization techniques** to make memories easily searchable and narratable. Additionally, we delved into the ethical concerns of data privacy, ensuring that user memories remain secure.  

## How We Built It  
- **Frontend:** Developed using **React Native** for a smooth cross-platform experience.  
- **Backend:** Powered by **Firebase** for real-time data storage and authentication.  
- **AI Integration:** Implemented **Face Recognition (Facenet512)** to identify people in images/videos.  
- **Audio Analysis:** Used **speech-to-text models (Chirp2)** to capture conversations and add context to memories.  
- **Summarization:** Finally, used Gemini's latest 2.0 flash model to summarize the long conversations into understandable summaries.
- **Memory Sorting:** Designed a **relationship-based profile system** to categorize moments based on people and events.  

## Challenges We Faced  
- **Facial Recognition Accuracy:** Training the AI to correctly identify people across different lighting, angles, and aging variations.  
- **Multi-Model Integration:** Coordinating multiple AI models—face recognition, speech-to-text, and contextual understanding—was complex. Ensuring they communicated efficiently and produced accurate, meaningful outputs required extensive tuning and optimization.  
- **User Experience:** Making the app intuitive for both tech-savvy users and those who may struggle with cognitive decline.  

## The Future of Memoir  
Our journey with **Memoir** is just beginning. We aim to integrate **voice-activated memory recall**, **AR storytelling**, and **collaborative memory-sharing** features. Our vision is to make Memoir a digital companion that not only stores moments but also tells the stories that matter.  We hope to do this  via a integration of meta glasses allowing for real time data to be transmated.

**Because memories shouldn’t just be stored—they should be remembered.**
